#155 (2008-01-02): Initial position module; also added FAT support for write w/ append;
                   trimmed out command set.
#149 (2007-12-29): Initial stubs for command line interface. Refactored out config and command
                   line tables from main (they are getting too large).
#148 (2007-12-28): Created YModem protocol module, supporting spec as per Chuck Forsberg [incl
                   1K and 'G' mode], except (a) send only, no receive, (b) support CRC16 only,
                   no checksum. User of module must provide io handlers for read/write/flush
                   with timeout (msec) capability. Test cases included. Verified against
                   external YModem clients from Unix command line.
#147 (2007-12-28): Refine naming for hardware versions and related descriptions in built
                   programs.
#142 (2007-07-12): Create 'time' format to support a ctime(3) style output driven from RMC
                   strings (the iQ will need to have been pre-programmed), which can be used
                   for pps clock synch tasks.
#141 (2007-07-11): Implement a uartN_write to reduce overhead of multiple calls to uartN_putc,
                   to improve serial I/O.
#139 (2007-07-10): Tagged: Release 0.94b.
#138 (2007-07-10): Critical: fixed uninitialised data defect in recent dual 'pass' & 'file'
                   output modes, causing extraneous data to be sent to the serial port if
                   'file' was configured, but 'pass' wasn't.
#136 (2007-07-10): Additional emulator command line option '--cfg-nowrite' prevents the
                   default GPSCONFG.TXT from being created. Useful when driving the emulator
                   entirely from command line options.
#134 (2007-07-10): Implement INLINE mechanism (pre-processor & makefile stunts) for selected
                   LPC HAL functions identified by gprof, in particular the spi's. This should
                   improve throughput on SD writes.
#133 (2007-07-10): Implement a uartN_gets to reduce overhead of multiple calls to uartN_getc,
                   this should help inbound serial I/O.
#131 (2007-07-10): Prevent 'compress' from applying to 'pass' output: it's for 'file' only.
                   This means if both 'pass' and 'file' are active and 'compress' is also set,
                   then the 'file' content will be compressed, but the 'pass' content won't.
                   You can't compress with 'pass' at all (for now, to be revised later).
#129 (2007-07-10): Allow convenience '***' wildcard to be used in 'format_nmea_sentences'.
#128 (2007-07-10): Implement automatic CHANGES support from 'svn log' (script, build, etc).
